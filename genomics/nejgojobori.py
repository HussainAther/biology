This method computes the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions and the numbers
of potentially synonymous and potentially nonsynonymous sites (Nei and Gojobori 1986).
Uses two homologous ORF sequences as input. The algorithm uses the alignment and separately
counts the number of non-synonymous and synonymous sites and differenecse between the sequences.
