"""
In the simplest model for a conjugated molecule, the electrons which form the pi orbitals
can sit on each carbon atom with some energy we set to zero. They hop from one atom to its
neighbors. There's one relevant electron per carbon atom. If we write the Hamiltonian for the 
electrons as a matrix, then for a ring of six carbons (benzene) we have a "hopping matrix
element" -t. It's negative as electrons lower their energy by being shared among neighboring
atoms through chemical bonds.
