"""
DALI: Distance matrix alignment uses fragments for constructing structural
alignemnts based on contact similarity patterns between successive hexapeptides in the
query seuqences. It generates pairwiese or multiple alignments and identifies a query sequence
structural neighbors from the protein data bank.

"""
SSAP: Sequenctial structure alignemnt uses atom-to-atom vectors in structure space as comparison
points. It's used in multiple and pairwise alignments to create CATH (Class, Archtiecture, Topology,
Homology) hierarchical database classification of protein folds.
