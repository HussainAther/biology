Kohonen map is a self-organizing map that rearranges data into an organized form, the "map"
of the data that can be divided into different regions to define categories. It uses dimensional reduction
to create a low-dimensionality from the large vectors of input data. We can easily visualize the major
differences and similarities in the data without having to htink in n-dimensional space.
