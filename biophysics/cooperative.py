We can look at how molecules work toegether with one another to cooperate 
when forming macromolecules. We can show how the rod elasticity models of polymers
can use phenomenological parameters of the stretch (fractional change in length
of a segment), bend (how the rod becomes deformed), and twist density (torsional deformation).
