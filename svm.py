Supprt vector machines use feature vectors representing training data separated into different regions by
a boundary line that can allow the feature space to follow a complex path. The SVM finds the boundary line by finding
the linear hyperplane that best separates the data in higher numbers of dimensions. The decision hyperplane is in the
middle of the widest margin in data classes, and this margin is itself determined by the support vectors.
